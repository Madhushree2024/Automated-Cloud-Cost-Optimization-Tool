Create the SNS Notification System:

In the SNS Console, create a Standard Topic named CloudCleanupAlerts.

Create an Email Subscription using your personal email.

Crucial: Check your inbox and click "Confirm Subscription."

Deploy the Lambda Function:

Create a new Lambda function named AutoResourceCleaner.

Important: Select Python 3.12 as the runtime (avoid Ruby or older versions).

Paste your Boto3 script into the code editor and replace the SNS_TOPIC_ARN with your actual ARN.

Configure Permissions:

Under the Configuration > Permissions tab, click the Role Name to open IAM.

Attach AmazonEC2FullAccess and AmazonSNSFullAccess.

Update the SNS Access Policy to allow lambda.amazonaws.com to perform the SNS:Publish action.

Set the Automation Trigger:

In the Lambda "Function overview," click + Add trigger.

Select EventBridge.

Create a new rule with a schedule expression like rate(1 minute) for testing or rate(7 days) for production.

Validation:

Create an "Available" (unattached) 1GB EBS volume.

Wait for the EventBridge trigger or click Test.

Check your CloudWatch logs to verify the execution time (e.g., 10:35 UTC) and check your email for the report.
